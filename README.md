# Virtual Machine in C++ and Assembler
This was a class project that was used to presents theory and concepts of high-performance computer architectures and focus on designing and implementing a simple assembler and virtual machine. I choose to write this project in C++, but can be written in any language of your choice.  The purpose of this is to provide you with some assistance in understanding NOT for reuse or copy.

I. Project 1
  The development and design of the virtual macine using C++
    
  
  Write the following assembly program using your assembly language.
  Place the following list of integers in memory 
  A = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
  B = (300, 150, 50, 20, 10, 5)
  C = (500, 2, 5, 10)
  Place your full name “Last Name, First Name” in contiguous memory.
